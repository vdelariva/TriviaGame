**How to Play:**

Trivia Quiz with 10 questions. The quiz starts automatically when the page is loaded. The user is given 30 seconds to answer the question and the remaining time is displayed on the screen.

The correct answer will be displayed after the user selects the right or wrong answer of if the time allocated to answer the question expires. Also displayed is a timer showing the user when the next question will be displayed.

Each time the quiz is started, the questions are randomized so that they are not displayed in the same order. The answers are also randomized. Used the Durstenfeld shuffle to shuffle both the questions and answers.
